The `analysis` subdirectory contains notebooks and scripts for analyzing data. 

For new projects, plain-text [quarto](https://quarto.org/) notebooks are recommended.

Every figure and statistic in the published paper should be reproducible from these notebooks. 

e.g. 

``` 
experiment1.qmd
experiment2.qmd
experiment3.qmd
```
