Complete raw data (captions, etc.) can be accessed as json files at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/108wX_FTxVf0T72LWk39scAbrN3L9o8yp/view?usp=sharing. A stripped-down dataset with information needed for plotting can be found in processed_data_cache.pkl, which was created from the raw json data using create_pickle.py. 

The generation_scripts folder contains files used to generate all synthetic descriptions with GPT-4o-mini as well as files used to generate CLIPscores (these were run on GPU).
