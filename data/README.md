The `data` sub-directory contains the output of experiments and model simulations, which serve as input to analyses.

Every study will have some 'raw' data (i.e. in the format it was in when it was exported) as well as some processed or 'clean' data.

For most behavioral studies (< 10MB), we can keep the raw data under version control. 

For datasets too big for GitHub (e.g. corpus analysis, fMRI), we will keep the raw data in another repository (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon S3).
